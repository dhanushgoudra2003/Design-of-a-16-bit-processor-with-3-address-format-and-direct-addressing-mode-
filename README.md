🛠 Functional Specifications
🔹 1. 16-Bit Architecture

    The processor operates on a 16-bit architecture, processing data in 16-bit chunks.

🔹 2. 3-Address Format

    Instructions contain three operands, enabling complex operations in a single cycle.

🔹 3. Direct Addressing Mode

    Instructions directly specify memory locations for faster data access.

🔹 4. Register File

    Contains a set of registers for quick data storage and retrieval, reducing memory access overhead.

🔹 5. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

    Capable of performing arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) operations.

🔹 6. Pipeline Architecture

    Implements a 2-stage pipeline, allowing multiple instructions to be executed simultaneously, improving throughput.

💻 Code Snippets & Implementation

The processor design was implemented and tested on a hardware simulation tool.

Sample code snippets demonstrating instruction execution are included in the project.
